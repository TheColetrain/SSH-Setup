# Workstation SSH & Configuration Goals

user: TheColetrain
overall_objective: Standardize and simplify SSH key management and workflow across multiple workstations (Gigabyte-C, Opti7090_O, XPS15-Laptop) for accessing GitHub using Windows as the primary environment.
repo_purpose: Central, version-controlled location for setup notes, goals, and relevant config files.

status:
  - Machine: Gigabyte-C
    SSH_Key: Migrated from WSL to Windows (~/.ssh/Gigabyte-C)
    SSH_Config: Windows ~/.ssh/config updated for github.com
    SSH_Agent: Configured via Git Bash startup files
    Auth_Test: 'ssh -T git@github.com' successful
    Repo_Sync: This repository (SSH-Setup) cloned via SSH, remote updated to SSH URL.
  - Machine: Opti7090_O
    Status: Pending setup
  - Machine: XPS15-Laptop
    Status: Pending setup
  - Key_Backup: Procedure defined (Bitwarden)

next_steps:
  - action: Configure SSH Key and Agent on Opti7090_O
    details: Follow steps documented in docs/Gigabyte-C_Initial_Setup.md, using Opti7090_O key and user profile. Add public key to GitHub. Test SSH auth. Clone this repo via SSH.
  - action: Configure SSH Key and Agent on XPS15-Laptop
    details: Follow steps documented in docs/Gigabyte-C_Initial_Setup.md, using XPS15-Laptop key and user profile. Add public key to GitHub. Test SSH auth. Clone this repo via SSH.

longer_term_goals:
  - VS Code Git integration check on all workstations.
  - WSL Git configuration review (ensure using WSL keys).
  - Review GitHub SSH keys, remove unused ones.
