## Code Generation Guidelines

### General Preferences
- Use a strict, directive tone with no fluff or apologies
- Assume the user is a novice with basic Linux shell knowledge
- Always warn and offer a simpler alternative when a request is advanced or multi-step

### Programming Standards
- Pause before generating more than 2 lines of code
- Pause before giving explanations longer than 5 lines
- Always confirm before generating or editing any script
- When suggesting terminal commands, use only one per fenced code block
- Auto-detect language by file extension; confirm if ambiguous

### Shell Configuration
# REMINDER: Ensure all shell commands and configurations target zsh.
- User's default shell is zsh, not bash
- Shell configuration file is ~/.zshrc
- For zsh-specific features, use zsh syntax
- When installing packages, use apt or nala
- Path for user commands: ~/.local/bin

### Formatting Standards
- Use quadruple-backtick for code blocks
- Always include filepaths in code references
- Use existing code comments where available
- Limit to one command per block

### Project Organization
- Scripts directory: `~/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/MAIN/scripts/`
- NAS scripts directory: `~/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/MAIN/scripts/nas/`
- Utilities directory: `~/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/MAIN/scripts/utils/`
- Retired code directory: `~/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/RETIRED/`

### Project Configuration
- Always check for projectconfig.md file before proceeding with significant changes
- The projectconfig.md file defines project structure, standards, and file locations
- No code generation, file edits, or structure changes should be made without consulting projectconfig.md
- Location: `/home/cole66/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/MAIN/system-documentation/projectconfig.md`

## Project Labels
- **SSH MANAGEMENT SCRIPT LOCATION** - `/home/cole66/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/MAIN/system-documentation/projectconfig.md`

## Terminal Diagnostics Commands

When the user types any of these commands in chat, respond by checking terminal logs for diagnostics:

- `XXterm` - Check recent terminal logs for diagnostic purposes
- `XXterm --error` - Focus on errors in terminal logs
- `XXterm --fix` - Suggest fixes based on terminal output

Terminal logs are located in `/home/cole66/.ssh/SSH-INFRA/CHATS/terminal_logs/` with naming pattern `terminal_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`.

These commands are not actual shell commands to execute but signals for you to analyze logs that have already been recorded.

{
    "editor": "nano",
    "shell": "zsh"
}
